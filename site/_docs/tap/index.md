#### This project is not currently maintained and will be refactored. If you are interested in TAP, join the discussion on our [dev list](mailto:dev-subscribe@flagon.incubator.apache.org). 

Tap is an experimental sandbox for Apache Flagon, highlighting customer visual analytics to highlight insights derived from Apache UserAle.js.  It consists of a React-Django web app that allows you to access your applications' usage data via data visualizations built in D3.

Work on Tap's documentation is ongoing.  To get involved, see our [Contributing]({{ '/docs/contributing' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) guide.  To get started with Tap, [try out the full Flagon system]({{ '/docs/stack' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
