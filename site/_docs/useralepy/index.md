Apache UserALE.PyQt5 is the UserALE client for PyQt5 applications.  It provides an easy way to generate highly detailed log streams from any PyQt5 application.

### Requirements

- Python 3.5 or above
- PyQt5, version 5.3 or above
- pip3, see requirements.txt

### Installing UserALE.PyQt5

The first step is to install Apache UserALE.PyQt5. First, checkout the latest version of Apache UserALE.PyQt5 from our Git repository.

  ```shell
  $ git clone https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-flagon-userale-pyqt5.git
  ```

Apache UserALE.PyQt5 is a python3 project, so it can be installed like any other python library. Several operating systems (Mac OS X, Major Versions of Linux/BSD) have Python3 pre-installed, so you should just have to run

  ```shell
  $ easy_install3 userale
  ```

      or

  ```shell
  $ pip3 install userale
  ```

Users are strongly recommended to install Apache UserALE.PyQt5 in a virtualenv. Instructions to setup an virtual environment will be explained below.

> **Note**
> Apache UserALE.PyQt5 requires that PyQt5 and the Qt5 bindings has been installed. Instructions to install PyQt5 and Qt5 in a virtual environment will be left to the user.

> **Note**
> When the package is installed via easy_install3 or pip3 this function will be bound to the userale executable in the Python installation’s bin directory (on Windows - the Scripts directory).

### Installing Apache UserALE.PyQt5 in an Virtual Environment

There are multiple ways to create virtual environments for a Python3 application. virtualenv is a one of those tools to create isolated Python environments. virtualenv creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that the UserAle project would need.

Start by changing directory into the root of Apache UserALE.PyQt5’s project directory, and then use the virtualenv command-line tool to create a new environment:

  ```shell
  $ virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 env
  ```

Optionally, Python3 has built in support for virtual environments.

  ```shell
  $ mkdir env
  $ python3 -m venv env
  ```

Activate environment:

  ```shell
  $ source env/bin/activate
  ```

Install UserAle requirements:

  ```shell
  $ env/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

To build the source code and run all unit tests.

  ```shell
  $ env/bin/python3 setup.py develop test
  ```

Deactivate environment

  ```shell
  $ deactivate
  ```

### Installing Documentation

First, install the documentation dependencies:

  ```shell
  $ env/bin/pip3 install -r doc_requirements.txt
  ```

To build Apache UserALE.PyQt5’s documentation, create a directory at the root level of /userale.pyqt5 called userale.pyqt5-docs.

  ```shell
  $ mkdir userale.pyqt5-docs & cd userale.pyqt5-docs
  ```

Execute build command from inside the top-level doc/ directory:

  ```shell
  $ make html
  ```

This should build the documentation in your shell, and output HTML. At then end, it should say something about documents being ready in userale.pyqt5-docs/html.

You can now open them in your browser by typing

  ```shell
  $ open userale.pyqt5-docs/html/index.html
  ```
